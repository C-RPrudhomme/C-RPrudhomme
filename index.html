      <h1 class="w3-center">About Chris</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">Media Production Undergraduate</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Chris Prudhomme is completing their Associate Degree in Media Production at Howard Community College. They possess a deep interest for arts that began with crayons, hello kitty notebooks, and their father’s phone camera. Chris knew that they wanted to be an artist from a young age, but they weren’t sure in what medium. Being homeschooled from ages seven to thirteen granted them a lot of time to experiment with painting, drawing, writing, photographing, and eventually producing films.
In highschool, Chris had the opportunity to participate in art contests and was featured in art shows locally in Howard County Maryland and they had the opportunity to publish photographs for HCPSS Pride magazine. Since highschool, Chris has published a short story, written scripts, directed and produced both comedic and dramatic short films, and continued work on their novel. Taking their art to social media, Chris has created an internet persona that posts alternative fashion and makeup content. Chris aspires to pursue a career in creative writing, both in scriptwriting and traditional publication. When Chris is not making art, they are a gymnast of twelve years. They are very involved in running a competitive gymnastics program and co-managing the recreational program at the gym where they work, creating a positive environment for kids in their community. In everything they do, Chris seeks to combine creativity with the joy they get in seeking out new experiences.
